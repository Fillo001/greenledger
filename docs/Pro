# GreenLedger — Project Proposal (DLT for Operations)

## 1) Problem
Climate and sustainability projects across Africa struggle with **proof and trust**: donors and governments can’t easily verify actions (e.g., trees planted, water points built), and communities don’t receive recognition or rewards. This leads to **greenwashing**, funding friction, and poor accountability.

## 2) Solution
**GreenLedger** is a **Hedera-based proof-of-action system**:
- Submit **geo-tagged evidence** (photo hash, coordinates, tags)
- Backend validates data and writes to **Hedera Consensus Service** (immutable log)
- Dashboard shows **real-time, auditable climate action**
- Future: tokenized incentives via **Hedera Token Service / smart contracts**

## 3) Track Fit — DLT for Operations
- Improves eco-operations by making actions **transparent, secure, efficient**
- Supports SDGs: **6 (Clean Water), 11 (Sustainable Cities), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Life on Land)**

## 4) Users & Benefits
- **NGOs & Donors**: verifiable impact, reduced fraud
- **Communities**: recognition & rewards
- **Governments**: audit-ready reporting

## 5) MVP Scope
- HCS topic for action logs
- API endpoint to submit actions
- Simple web form to create actions

## 6) Tech Stack
- **DLT:** Hedera (HCS now; HTS/tokens later)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + `@hashgraph/sdk`
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Storage:** IPFS (future for media); store **hashes** now

## 7) Success Metrics
- Time to verify action < 5s
- Cost per action log < $0.01
- 3 pilot communities; 1 NGO partner

## 8) Roadmap
- **M1:** MVP (HCS + form) — submission
- **M2:** Role-based dashboards; map view; CSV export
- **M3:** Token rewards (HTS) + mobile PWA

## 9) Risks & Mitigation
- **Fake evidence** → multi-factor proofs (geo, timestamp, reviewer), community validators
- **Connectivity** → offline capture, later sync
- **Privacy** → store hashes on-chain; sensitive data off-chain

## 10) Team & Needs
- PM/Founder, Frontend, Backend, DLT devs; NGO partner
- Looking for mentors on **Hedera HTS** and **impact measurement**
